# Apollo

This is a module to extract mode frequencies. The framework is there but you may encounter bugs since it is still under development. The procedure is illustrated in [Li et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.2363L/abstract)

The goal is to provide workflows for the following tasks:
- extract numax and Dnu from power spectra with a simple treatment,
- perform mode identification (l and m degrees) with interactive widgets for visual vetting,
- and fit mode frequencies, a process known as peakbagging.
